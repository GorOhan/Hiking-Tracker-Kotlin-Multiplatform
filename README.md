## Architecture 🏢
The Kotlin Multiplatform Hiking Application is built using the Clean Architecture and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. 

<!--
### Android 📱

When Android is one of your targets, 
you can get the same experience for Android as if you were developing an Android app using Jetpack Compose.

<!--
### IOS 📱
> iOS support is in Alpha. It may change incompatibly and require manual migration in the future.

Compose Multiplatform shares most of its API with Jetpack Compose, the Android UI framework developed by Google. 
You can use the same APIs to build user interfaces for both Android and iOS.
